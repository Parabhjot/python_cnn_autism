# python_cnn_autism
A CNN classifying autism created using Keras in Python

My wife works with children with Autism as a Senior Behaviour Therapist. From what I have learned about autism from my wife, I know that patients with autism have noticeable differences in facial features. I think creating an image classifier would be a great method of combining my passion for data science with my wife's passion in helping children with disabilities. 

Data Retrieved from: https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/autistic-children-data-set-traintestvalidate

The model was created using the training/validatin set retrieved from kaggle above. The model was saved as a .h5 file and can be loaded and run on new images using the last 4 cells of code.
