# python_cnn_autism
A CNN classifying autism created using Keras in Python

My wife works with children with Autism as a Senior Behaviour Therapist. From what I have learned about autism from my wife, I know that patients with autism have noticeable differences in facial features. I think creating an image classifier would be a great method of combining my passion for data science with my wife's passion in helping children with disabilities.
